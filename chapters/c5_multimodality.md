# Multimodality

- Items have content that describe them
  - Images,
  - Text
  - Related Productds

-  Users have ‚Äúcontent‚Äù too
 - Photos
 - Friends  

- Automatic Feature Extraction:
  - Text: Document Vector (like traditional way: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT)
  - Image: Vector of Features (CNN)
  - Graph: Vector of Edges (Graph Convolution Network)
# Model with Graph Modality
- SoRec: Social Recommendation Extends PMF with Graph Modality
  - Social Network Graph: Graph between Users
  - User-Item Matrix: which we can factorize using MF

# Cornac-Supported Graph-Based Models
- User network:
  - Social Recommendation using PMF, SoRec
    - PMF is only for User-Item MF, not include User Graph, but it is a based for SoRec (SoRec in-cooperate with User Graph) 
  - Social Bayesian Personalized Ranking (SBPR) 
- Item network:
  - Collaborative Context Poisson Factorization (C2PF)
  - Probabilistic Collaborative Representation Learning (PCRL)
  - Matrix Co-Factorization (MCF)
